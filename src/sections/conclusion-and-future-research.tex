In this manuscript we have discussed partial time scale differential equation involving derivatives of polynomials
in context of time scale $\Lambda^2 = \mathbb{T}_1 \times \mathbb{T}_2$ where $\mathbb{T}_1 = \mathbb{T}_2$.
Future research can be conducted to study the case $\mathbb{T}_1 \neq \mathbb{T}_2$,
which makes the theorem ~\ref{main_theorem} to be generalised
\[
    \pTsDerivative{\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}}{x} +
    \pTsDerivative{\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}}{b}
    = \alpha_m(x,b) (x^{2m+1})^{\Delta}
\]
where $\alpha_m(x,b)$ is arbitrary differentiable function.
Also, it is worth to discuss the theorem~\ref{main_theorem} in context of high order derivatives on time scales.
We have established a few power identities, and shown the theorem~\ref{main_theorem} for different 2-dimensional
time scales $\Lambda^2$ like integer time scale $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, real time scale $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$,
quantum time scale $q^{\mathbb{R}} \times q^{\mathbb{R}}$ and quantum power time scale $\mathbb{R}^q \times \mathbb{R}^q$.
