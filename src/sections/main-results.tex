Time scale derivative of the polynomial $t^{2m+1}$ may be expressed as follows
\begin{thm}
    \label{main_theorem}
    Let $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ be a $2m+1-$degree integer-valued polynomial defined by~\eqref{eq:polynomial_p}.
    Let be a two-dimensional time scale
    $\Lambda^2 = \mathbb{T}_1 \times \mathbb{T}_2 = \{t=(x, b) \colon \; x\in\mathbb{T}_1, \; b\in\mathbb{T}_2 \}$.
    Let be $\mathbb{T}_1 = \mathbb{T}_2$.
    For every $t\in\mathbb{T}_1, \; x,b\in \Lambda^2, \; m\in\mathbb{N}, \; m = const$
    \[
        (t^{2m+1})^{\Delta} =
        \frac{\partial \polynomialP{m}{b}{x}}{\Delta x} \bigg |_{x = t, \; b = \sigma(t)}+
        \frac{\partial \polynomialP{m}{b}{x}}{\Delta b} \bigg |_{x = t, \; b = t}, \quad m = 0,1,2,\dots,
    \]
    where
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{1em}
        \item  $\sigma(t) > t$ is forward jump operator,

        \item $\frac{\partial \polynomialP{m}{b}{x}}{\Delta x} \bigg |_{x = t, \; b = \sigma(t)}$
        is the value of the partial derivative on time scales of
        $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ with respect to the variable $x$, evaluated at $x = t, \; b = \sigma(t)$,

        \item $\frac{\partial \polynomialP{m}{b}{x}}{\Delta b} \bigg |_{x = t, \; b = t}$
        is the value of the partial derivative on time scales of
        $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ with respect to the variable $b$, evaluated at $x = t, \; b = t$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}
In other words, theorem ~\ref{main_theorem} says
\begin{center}
    \begin{quotation}
        For every odd-exponent polynomial $t^{2m+1}$, its derivative on time scales equals to the sum
        of the value of the partial derivative on time scales of
        $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$
        with respect to the variable
        $x$,
        evaluated at
        $x = t, \; b = \sigma(t)$
        and the value of the partial derivative on time scales of
        $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$
        with respect to the variable
        $b$,
        evaluated at
        $x = t, \; b = t$.
    \end{quotation}
\end{center}

In extended form theorem ~\ref{main_theorem} may be written as

\begin{align*}
(t^{2m+1})
    ^{\Delta}_{t} =
    \frac{\partial}{\Delta x} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{b-1} \sum_{r=0}^{m} \coeffA{m}{r} k^r(x-k)^r \right) \Bigg |_{x = t, \; b = \sigma(t)}
    + \frac{\partial}{\Delta b} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{b-1} \sum_{r=0}^{m} \coeffA{m}{r} k^r(x-k)^r \right) \Bigg |_{x = t, \; b = t}
\end{align*}
