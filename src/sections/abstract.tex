Let $\mathbf{P}_b^m(x)$ be a $2m+1-$degree integer-valued polynomial in $x,b$.
Let be a two-dimensional time scale
$\Lambda^2 = \mathbb{T}_1 \times \mathbb{T}_2 = \{t=(x, b) \colon \; x\in\mathbb{T}_1, \; b\in\mathbb{T}_2 \}$.
Let be $\mathbb{T}_1 = \mathbb{T}_2$.
In this manuscript we derive and discuss the following partial dynamic equation on time scales.
For every $t\in\mathbb{T}_1, \; x,b\in \Lambda^2, \; m\in\mathbb{N}$
\[
    (t^{2m+1})^{\Delta}_{t} =
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{P}_b^m(x)}{\Delta x} \bigg |_{x = t, \; b = \sigma(t)}+
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{P}_b^m(x)}{\Delta b}\bigg |_{x = t, \; b = t}, \quad m = 0,1,2,\dots
\]
where $\sigma(t) > t$ is forward jump operator.
In addition, we discuss various derivative operators in context of partial cases of above equation,
we show finite difference, classical derivative, $q-$derivative, $q-$power derivative on behalf of it.
