Let $P(m,b,x)$ be a $2m+1$-degree polynomial in $x,b$.
Let be a two-dimensional timescale
$\Lambda^2 = \mathbb{T}_1 \times \mathbb{T}_2 = \{t=(x, b) \colon \; x\in\mathbb{T}_1, \; b\in\mathbb{T}_2 \}$
such that $\mathbb{T}_1 = \mathbb{T}_2$.
In this manuscript we derive and discuss an identity that connects the timescale derivative of odd-power polynomial
with partial derivatives of polynomial $P(m,b,x)$ evaluated in particular points.
For every $t\in\mathbb{T}_1$ and $x,b\in \Lambda^2$
\[
    \frac{\Delta x^{2m+1}}{\Delta x}(t) =
    \frac{\partial P(m,b,x)}{\Delta x} (m, \sigma(t), t) +
    \frac{\partial P(m,b,x)}{\Delta b} (m, t, t)
\]
such that $\sigma(t) > t$ is forward jump operator.
In addition, we discuss various derivative operators in context of partial cases of above equation,
we show finite difference, classical derivative, $q-$derivative, $q-$power derivative on behalf of it.
